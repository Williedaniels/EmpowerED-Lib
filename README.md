## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your development machine:

- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (for iOS development)
- [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) (for iOS dependency management)

### Installation

2. Connect your iOS device or select a simulator.

3. In Xcode, select your target device and click the **Run** button or use the shortcut `Cmd + R`.

## Running on Android Devices

While EmpowerED-Lib is written in Swift and primarily intended for iOS, Android users can still access the app through the following methods:

### Method 1: Use an iOS Simulator on a Mac

1. If you have access to a Mac, you can use Xcode's iOS simulator to run the app and share the screen with your Android device.

2. Alternatively, use remote desktop applications to access a Mac running the app from your Android device.

### Method 2: Web Version

1. Create a web version of the app using a framework like [SwiftUI for Web](https://github.com/SwiftWebUI/SwiftWebUI) or [Vapor](https://vapor.codes/).

2. Deploy the web version and access it via any browser on Android devices.

### Method 3: Use a Third-Party Service

1. Services like [Appetize.io](https://appetize.io/) can run iOS apps in the browser. Upload your app to Appetize.io and access it from any device, including Android.
